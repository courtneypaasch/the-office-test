# The Office Quiz

This assignment was designed to challenge my understanding of user interactivity and the logic required to process that input. I was asked to design a quiz game that gave the player a set amount of time to answer all the given questions with incorrect answers resulting in a time deduction. The final score is how long you had left when you finished. The game also alerts whether or not your answers were correct in real time. 

The concepts explored in this assignment are applicable across the web. Every website requires some input or accepts clicks from the user in order to perform an action which is why the logic in this activity is crucial.

Here is a link to the game's Github page: https://courtneypaasch.github.io/the-office-test/index.html

Here are screenshots of the functioning game:
